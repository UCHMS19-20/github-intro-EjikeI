# ***What I know about GitHub***

*I know that...*

* Repositories are collections of files
* The 'commit' command saves files
* I can have multiple branches and merge them together whenever I need to
* Snapshots summarize the work that you do at a set time
* You can work offline
* You need to add an edit to 'staging' for it to be part of the next snapshot
* Github keeps track of history
* README is generally the first file you should open
